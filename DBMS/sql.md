## SQL 

SQL: Structured Query Language, used to access and manipulate data.
SQL used CRUD operations to communicate with DB.

1. CREATE - execute INSERT statements to insert new tuple into the relation.
2. READ - Read data already in the relations.
3. UPDATE - Modify already inserted data in the relation.
4. DELETE - Delete specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows.

SQL is not DB, is a query language.

### What is RDBMS? (Relational Database Management System)

1. Software that enables us to implement designed relational model.
2. e.g., MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, IBM etc.
3. Table/Relation is the simplest form of data storage object in R-DB.
4. MySQL is open-source RDBMS, and it uses SQL for all CRUD operations.
5. MySQL uses a client-server model, where the client is CLI or frontend that uses services provided by the MySQL server.

### Difference between SQL and MySQL

SQL is Structured Query language used to perform CRUD operations in R-DB, while MySQL is an RDBMS used to store, manage, and administrate DB (provided by itself) using SQL.

## SQL Data Types

In SQL DB, data is stored in the form of tables. Data can be of different types, like INT, CHAR etc.

| Data Type   | Description                                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| CHAR        | Fixed-length string, maximum length up to 255 characters. |
| VARCHAR     | Variable-length string, maximum length up to 65535 characters. |
| TINYTEXT    | String with a maximum length of 255 characters.        |
| TEXT        | String with a maximum length of 65535 characters.      |
| MEDIUMTEXT  | String with a maximum length of 16777215 characters.   |

| TIMESTAMP   | YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format                                  |
| TIME        | HH:MM:SS format                                        |
| ENUM        | One of the preset values.                               |

## Types of SQL Commands

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

Defines relation schema.

1. CREATE: create table, DB, view.
2. ALTER TABLE: modification in table structure, e.g., change column datatype or add/remove columns.
3. DROP: delete table, DB, view.
4. TRUNCATE: remove all the tuples from the table.
5. RENAME: rename DB name, table name, column name etc.

### DRL/DQL (Data Retrieval Language / Data Query Language)

Retrieves data from the tables.

1. SELECT: retrieve specific columns from one or more tables.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Modifies data in the tables.

1. INSERT: insert data into a relation.
2. UPDATE: update relation data.
3. DELETE: delete row(s) from the relation.

### DCL (Data Control Language)

Manages user access rights.

1. GRANT: access privileges to the DB.
2. REVOKE: revoke user access privileges.

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Manages transactions in the DB.

1. START TRANSACTION: begin a transaction.
2. COMMIT: apply all the changes and end transaction.
3. ROLLBACK: discard changes and end transaction.
4. SAVEPOINT: set a checkpoint within a transaction.

## Conclusion
SQL is a powerful language for managing and manipulating relational databases. Understanding its various commands and constructs enables efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management. Whether working with small-scale databases or large enterprise systems, SQL remains fundamental in interacting with data effectively.
