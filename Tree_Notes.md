# 1. Introduction to Trees

A tree is a non-linear data structure that is used to store data in a hierarchical manner. It is a collection of nodes connected by edges.

Each node will contain a data element and a list of references to other nodes (children).
There are different types of trees like Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.
Trees are used to represent hierarchical data like file systems, organization structure, etc. Trees are a subset of Graphs.

## 2. Basic Terminologies

- **Node**: A node is a basic unit of a tree. It contains data and references to other nodes.
- **Root**: The topmost node in a tree is called the root node.
- **Parent**: A node that has child nodes is called a parent node.
- **Child**: A node that is a descendant of another node is called a child node.
- **Leaf**: A node that does not have any child nodes is called a leaf node.
- **Edge**: The connection between two nodes is called an edge.
- **Height**: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
- **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root node to that node.
- **Level**: The level of a node is the depth of the node + 1.
- **Subtree**: A subtree is a tree that is part of a larger tree.
- **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children is called a binary tree.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree in which the left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node is called a binary search tree.
- **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one is called a balanced tree.
- **Complete Tree**: A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right is called a complete tree.
- **Full Tree**: A binary tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children is called a full tree.
- **Perfect Tree**: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level is called a perfect tree.
- **Traversal**: The process of visiting all the nodes in a tree is called traversal. There are three types of tree traversal: **_Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder_**.

# 3. Binary Tree

Binary tree is a data structure in which each node can have at most two children. The children are referred to as the left child and the right child. The left child is the child node that is on the left side of the parent node, and the right child is the child node that is on the right side of the parent node.

### Representation of Binary Tree

Each node in a binary tree contains three fields:

- **Data**: The data element stored in the node.
- **Left**: A reference to the left child node.
- **Right**: A reference to the right child node.

Example

```cpp
// Defining as a struct
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
};
// Defining as a class
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};
```

# 4. Types of Binary Trees

1. **On the basis of number of children** :
   - **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children is called a full binary tree.
   - **Degenerate or Pathological Tree**: A binary tree in which each parent node has only one child is called a degenerate tree.
   - **Skewed Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all the nodes have only one child is called a skewed binary tree.
2. **On the basis of Completion of Levels** :
   - **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right is called a complete binary tree.
   - **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level is called a perfect binary tree.
   - **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one is called a balanced binary tree.
3. **On the basis of Node Values** :
   - **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree in which the left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node is called a binary search tree.
   - **AVL Tree**: A binary search tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one and the left and right subtrees are also AVL trees is called an AVL tree.
   - **Red-Black Tree**: A binary search tree in which each node is colored either red or black and the root node is always black is called a red-black tree.
   - **B-Tree**: A self-balancing tree in which each node can have more than two children is called a B-tree.
   - **B+ Tree**: A self-balancing tree in which each node can have more than two children and all the data is stored in the leaf nodes is called a B+ tree.
   - **Segment Tree**: A tree used for storing intervals or segments is called a segment tree.

# 5. Operations on Binary Trees

1. **Insertion**: Insert a new node in the binary tree.
   We can insert a node anywhere in the binary tree by inserting the node as a left or right child of any node OR by making it the root of the tree.

- **Algorithm to insert a node in a Binary Tree**
  - Check if there is a node whose left child is NULL, then insert the new node as the left child of that node.
  - Check if there is a node whose right child is NULL, then insert the new node as the right child of that node.
  - If no such nodes are found then find a leaf node and insert the new node as the left child of that node.

2. **Tree Traversals** :

- Depth First Traversals:
  - Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
  - Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
  - Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
- Breadth First Traversal:
  - Level Order Traversal

3. **Deletion**: We can delete any node from the binary tree and rearrange the nodes after deletion to again form a valid binary tree.

- **Algorithm to delete a node from a Binary Tree**

  - Find the node to be deleted.
  - If the node has no children, then simply delete the node.
  - If the node has one child, then replace the node with its child.
  - If the node has two children, then find the inorder successor of the node, replace the node with the inorder successor, and delete the inorder successor.

- Inorder Successor: The inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the given node.

4. **Searching**: We can search for a node in a binary tree by traversing the tree and comparing the key of each node with the key we are searching for.

- **Algorithm to search for a node in a Binary Tree**
  - Start from the root node.
  - If the key of the current node is equal to the key we are searching for, then return the current node.
  - If the key of current node is not equal to the key we are searching for, then recursively search in the left and right subtrees.
  - If the key is not found in the tree, then return NULL.

# 6. Binary Tree Traversals

## 1. Inorder Traversal

In inorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order: left, root, right.

```cpp
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}
```

## 2. Preorder Traversal

In preorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order: root, left, right.

```cpp
void preorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    cout << root->data << " ";
    preorder(root->left);
    preorder(root->right);
}
```

## 3. Postorder Traversal

In postorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order: left, right, root.

```cpp
void postorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    postorder(root->left);
    postorder(root->right);
    cout << root->data << " ";
}
```

## 4. Reverse inorder Traversal

In reverse inorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order: right, root, left.

```cpp
void reverseInorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    reverseInorder(root->right);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    reverseInorder(root->left);
}
```

## 5. Level Order Traversal

In level order traversal, the nodes are visited level by level from left to right.
We will be using a queue to store the nodes at each level.

```cpp
void levelOrder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* current = q.front();
        cout << current->data << " ";
        if (current->left != NULL) q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right != NULL) q.push(current->right);
        q.pop();
    }
}
```

## 6. Spiral Order Traversal

In spiral order traversal, the nodes are visited level by level in a zigzag manner.

Lets say the tree is like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    7  6 5  4
```

Then the spiral order traversal will be: 1 3 2 7 6 5 4

```cpp
void spiralOrder(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    stack<Node*> s1, s2;
    s1.push(root);
    while (!s1.empty() || !s2.empty()) {
        while (!s1.empty()) {
            Node* current = s1.top();
            s1.pop();
            cout << current->data << " ";
            if (current->right != NULL) s2.push(current->right);
            if (current->left != NULL) s2.push(current->left);
        }
        while (!s2.empty()) {
            Node* current = s2.top();
            s2.pop();
            cout << current->data << " ";
            if (current->left != NULL) s1.push(current->left);
            if (current->right != NULL) s1.push(current->right);
        }
    }
}
```

## 7. Morris Traversal

Morris traversal is an efficient way to traverse a binary tree without using any extra space. It is based on the concept of threading.

```cpp
void morrisInorder(Node* root) {
    Node* current = root;
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->left == NULL) {
            cout << current->data << " ";
            current = current->right;
        } else {
            Node* predecessor = current->left;
            while (predecessor->right != NULL && predecessor->right != current) {
                predecessor = predecessor->right;
            }
            if (predecessor->right == NULL) {
                predecessor->right = current;
                current = current->left;
            } else {
                predecessor->right = NULL;
                cout << current->data << " ";
                current = current->right;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 8. Vertical Order Traversal

Vertical order traversal is a traversal in which nodes are visited level by level in a vertical order.

Lets say the tree is like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

Then the vertical order traversal will be: 4 2 1 5 6 3 7
A map is used to store the nodes at each horizontal distance from the root node.
A queue is used to perform the BFS traversal. Each element in the queue is a pair of the node and its horizontal distance from the root.

The front of the queue is popped and the node is inserted into the map at the corresponding horizontal distance.
Then the left child is pushed into the queue with a horizontal distance of hd - 1 and the right child is pushed into the queue with a horizontal distance of hd + 1.

After the traversal is complete, the nodes are printed from the map in ascending order of the horizontal distance.

```cpp
void verticalOrder(Node* root) {
    map<int, vector<int>> m;
    queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
    q.push({root, 0});
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* current = q.front().first;
        int hd = q.front().second;
        q.pop();
        m[hd].push_back(current->data);
        if (current->left != NULL) q.push({current->left, hd - 1});
        if (current->right != NULL) q.push({current->right, hd + 1});
    }
    for (auto it = m.begin(); it != m.end(); it++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < it->second.size(); i++) {
            cout << it->second[i] << " ";
        }
    }
}
```

## 9. Diameter of a Binary Tree

Diameter of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.

Lets say the tree is like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

Then the diameter of the tree will be 5 (4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7)

```cpp
int diameterOfTree(Node* root, int& diameter) {
    if (root == NULL) return 0;
    int leftHeight = diameterOfTree(root->left, diameter);
    int rightHeight = diameterOfTree(root->right, diameter);
    diameter = max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
    return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
}
```

## 10. Height of a Binary Tree

Height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

```cpp
int heightOfTree(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return 0;
    return 1 + max(heightOfTree(root->left), heightOfTree(root->right));
}
```

## 11. Lowest Common Ancestor

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree is the lowest node that has both the nodes as its descendants.

Lets say the tree is like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

Then the LCA of 4 and 5 will be 2.
LCA of 5 and 7 is 1.

The following code snippet finds the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree.
First, we check if the root is NULL or if the root is one of the nodes we are looking for.
Then we recursively find the LCA in the left and right subtrees.

- If we take the p =4 and q = 5
- First call will be lowestCommonAncestor(1, 4, 5)
- Second call will be lowestCommonAncestor(2, 4, 5)
- Third call will be lowestCommonAncestor(4, 4, 5) which will return 4
- Fourth call will be lowestCommonAncestor(5, 4, 5) which will return 5
- Then the left will be 4 and right will be 5, so since both are not NULL, we return the root which is 2.
- For the first call the left will be 2 and right will be null, so we return 2.

```cpp
Node* lowestCommonAncestor(Node* root, Node* p, Node* q) {
    if (root == NULL || root == p || root == q) return root;
    Node* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
    Node* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
    if (left == NULL) return right;
    if (right == NULL) return left;
    return root;
}
```

## 12. Maximum Width of a Binary Tree

Maximum width of a binary tree is the maximum number of nodes present at any level in the binary tree.

Lets say the tree is like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

Then the maximum width of the tree will be 4 (4, 5, 6, 7)

We will be using a queue to store the nodes at each level.
We will be using a count variable to store the number of nodes at each level.
Add the first node to the queue and then iterate over the queue.
For each node, update the count value to size of queue and then run a for loop for the count value.
Update result to max of result and count.
Inside the for loop pop the front node and push the left and right child nodes if they are not NULL.

```cpp
int maxWidth(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return 0;
    int result = 0;
    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int count = q.size();
        result = max(result, count);
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            Node* current = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (current->left != NULL) q.push(current->left);
            if (current->right != NULL) q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

# 7. Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node.

Example of a binary search tree

```
            4
           / \
          2   6
         / \ / \
        1  3 5  7
```

## Searching in a Binary Search Tree

- **Algorithm to search for a key in a Binary Search Tree**
  - Start from the root node.
  - If the key of the current node is equal to the key we are searching for, then return the current node.
  - If the key of the current node is less than the key we are searching for, then recursively search in the right subtree.
  - If the key of the current node is greater than the key we are searching for, then recursively search in the left subtree.
  - If the key is not found in the tree, then return NULL.

Code snippet

```cpp
Node* search(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == NULL || root->data == key) return root;
    if (root->data < key) return search(root->right, key);
    return search(root->left, key);
}
```

## Deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree

- **Algorithm to delete a node from a BST**
  - If the node to be deleted is a leaf node, then simply delete the node.
  - If the node to be deleted has only one child, then replace the node with its child.
  - If the node to be deleted has two children, then find the inorder successor of the node, replace the node with the inorder successor, and delete the inorder successor.

Code snippet:
This function deletes a node with the given key from the binary search tree.
If the root is NULL, then return NULL.
If the key is less than the root's data, then recursively delete the key from the left subtree.
If the key is greater than the root's data, then recursively delete the key from the right subtree.
If the key is equal to the root's data, then check if the root has one child or no child.
If the root has no child, then delete the root and return NULL.
If the root has one child, then replace the root with its child and delete the root.
If the root has two children, then we need to find the inorder successor of the root.
The inorder successor is the smallest node in the right subtree of the root.
Replace the root's data with the inorder successor's data.
Recursively delete the inorder successor from the right subtree.

> Why we need to find the inorder successor? Inorder successor is the smallest node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted. When we swap the data of the node to be deleted with the inorder successor, the right side of the node to be deleted will remain smaller than the copied value. And the right side of the inorder successor will remain greater than the copied value. So, the BST property will be maintained.

```cpp
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == NULL){
        return root;
    }
    if (key < root->data){
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    }
    else if (key > root->data){
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    }
    else {
        if (root->left == NULL) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (root->right == NULL) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        Node* temp = root->right;

        while (temp->left != NULL)
            temp = temp->left;

        root->data = temp->data;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
    }
    return root;
}
```

## 1. Finding node with minimum value in a BST

Consider the following BST:

```
            4
           / \
          2   6
         / \ / \
        1  3 5  7
```

The minimum value in the above BST is 1.
We just need to find the left most node in the BST.

```cpp
Node* minValueNode(Node* root) {
    Node* current = root;
    while (current->left != NULL) {
        current = current->left;
    }
    return current;
}
```

## 2. Find the inorder predecessor and successor of a given key in a BST

In a BST, the inorder predecessor of a node is the node with the largest key smaller than the given key, and the inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the given key.

**Algorithm** :
Input - root node, key
Output - predecessor node, successor node

1. If the root is NULL, return.
2. if the key is found then
   - If its left subtree is not null
     Then predecessor will be the right most
     child of left subtree or left child itself.
   - If its right subtree is not null
     The successor will be the left most child
     of right subtree or right child itself.
     return
3. If the key is smaller than the root node
   set the successor as root
   search recursively into the left subtree
   else
   set the predecessor as root
   search recursively into the right subtree

```cpp
void findPreSuc(Node* root, Node*& pre, Node*& suc, int key) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;

    if (root->data == key) {
        if (root->left != NULL) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            while (temp->right)
                temp = temp->right;
            pre = temp;
        }
        if (root->right != NULL) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            while (temp->left)
                temp = temp->left;
            suc = temp;
        }
        return;
    }
    if (root->data > key) {
        suc = root;
        findPreSuc(root->left, pre, suc, key);
    } else {
        pre = root;
        findPreSuc(root->right, pre, suc, key);
    }
}
```

initially pre and suc will be `NULL`.

## 3. Check if a binary tree is a BST

We need to check if the left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node for each node in the binary tree.

```cpp
bool isBST(Node* root, Node* l, Node* r) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return true;
    if (l != NULL && root->data <= l->data)
        return false;
    if (r != NULL && root->data >= r->data)
        return false;

    return isBST(root->left, l, root) && isBST(root->right, root, r);
}
```

We can check only till specific range of values.

```cpp
bool isBST(Node* root, int min, int max) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return true;
    if (root->data < min || root->data > max)
        return false;
    return isBST(root->left, min, root->data - 1) && isBST(root->right, root->data + 1, max);
}
```

## 4. Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST

Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root [i.e., closest to n1 and n2].

**Algorithm** :
Input - root node, node1, node2
Output - LCA node

1. If the root is NULL, return NULL.
2. If both node1 and node2 are smaller than the root, then the LCA will be in the left subtree.
3. If both node1 and node2 are greater than the root, then the LCA will be in the right subtree.
4. If one node is smaller and the other is greater than the root, then the root will be the LCA.

```cpp
Node* LCA(Node* root, Node* p, Node* q) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return NULL;
    if (root->data > p->data && root->data > q->data) {
        return LCA(root->left, p, q);
    }
    else if (root->data < p->data && root->data < q->data) {
        return LCA(root->right, p, q);
    }
    else {
        return root;
    }
}
```

Iterative approach:

```cpp
Node* LCA(Node* root, Node* p, Node* q) {
    while (root != NULL) {
        if (root->data > p->data && root->data > q->data) {
            root = root->left;
        }
        else if (root->data < p->data && root->data < q->data) {
            root = root->right;
        }
        else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return root;
}
```

## 5. Balancing a BST

A binary search tree is said to be balanced if the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most one.
Given a binary search tree, we can balance it by constructing a new balanced binary search tree from the given binary search tree.

**Algorithm** :
Input - root node
Output - balanced root node

1. First, we will store the inorder traversal of the binary search tree in an array.
2. Then, we will construct a new balanced binary search tree from the inorder traversal array using the following steps:
   - Find the middle element of the array and make it the root of the new tree.
   - Recursively construct the left subtree from the left part of the array.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree from the right part of the array.

```cpp
Node* balanceBST(Node* root) {
    vector<int> inorder;
    inorderTraversal(root, inorder);
    return constructBalancedBST(inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1);
}

void inorderTraversal(Node* root, vector<int>& inorder) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left, inorder);
    inorder.push_back(root->data);
    inorderTraversal(root->right, inorder);
}

Node* constructBalancedBST(vector<int>& inorder, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) return NULL;
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    Node* root = new Node(inorder[mid]);
    root->left = constructBalancedBST(inorder, start, mid - 1);
    root->right = constructBalancedBST(inorder, mid + 1, end);
    return root;
}
```

## 6. Convert a binary search tree to a sorted doubly linked list

The advantage of a binary search tree is that it can be used to create a sorted doubly linked list efficiently.

- In the doubly linked list format, the left pointer of the node will point to the previous node in the sorted order, and the right pointer will point to the next node in the sorted order.

**Algorithm** :
Input - root node
Output - head of the sorted doubly linked list

1. We will perform an inorder traversal of the binary search tree.
2. While performing the inorder traversal, we will keep track of the previous node.
3. For each node, we will set the left pointer to the previous node and the right pointer to the next node.
4. Finally, we will return the head of the doubly linked list.

```cpp
Node* treeToDoublyList(Node* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
    Node* head = NULL;
    Node* prev = NULL;
    inorder(root, prev, head);
    prev->right = head;
    head->left = prev;
    return head;
}

void inorder(Node* root, Node*& prev, Node*& head) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    inorder(root->left, prev, head);
    if (prev == NULL) {
        head = root;
    } else {
        prev->right = root;
        root->left = prev;
    }
    prev = root;
    inorder(root->right, prev, head);
}
```

Example
Let the BST be like this:

```
        4
       / \
      2   6
     / \ / \
    1  3 5  7
```

After converting to doubly linked list, it will be like this:

```
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7
```

## 7. Finding kth smallest element in a BST ( Order statistics of BST)

We can find the kth smallest element in a BST by performing an inorder traversal of the BST and keeping track of the count of nodes visited.

**Algorithm** :
Input - root node, k
Output - kth smallest element

1. Perform an inorder traversal of the BST.
2. While performing the inorder traversal, keep track of the count of nodes visited.
3. When the count reaches k, return the current node.

```cpp
Node* kthSmallest(Node* root, int& k) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return NULL;
    Node* left = kthSmallest(root->left, k);

    if (left != NULL)
        return left;

    k--;
    if (k == 0)
        return root;

    return kthSmallest(root->right, k);
}
```

## 8. Merging two BSTs into one BST in limited space

the idea is to use iterative inorder traversal of both trees and merge the elements in sorted order.

**Algorithm** :

1. Consider two stacks s1 and s2 which stores the elements of two trees
2. Store the left view value of a tree1 in s1 and of tree2 in s2.
   Compare the top values present in the stack and push the value accordingly in the result vector.
   - If s2 is empty then pop s1 and put the popped node value in the answer vector
   - Else if both s1 and s2 are not empty then compare their top nodes’ value if s1.top()->val <= s2.top()->val then in this case push the s1.top()->val in the result vector and push its right child in the stack s1.
   - If s1 is empty then pop s2 and put the popped node value in the answer vector.
   - Else if both s1 and s2 are not empty then compare their top nodes’ value if `s2.top()->val >= s1.top()->val` then in this case push the `s2.top()->val` in the result vector and push its right child in the stack s2.
   - Loop while there are nodes not yet printed. The nodes may be in the stack(explored, but not printed) or maybe not yet explored

```cpp

Node* constructBalancedBST(vector<int>& inorder, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) return NULL;
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    Node* root = new Node(inorder[mid]);
    root->left = constructBalancedBST(inorder, start, mid - 1);
    root->right = constructBalancedBST(inorder, mid + 1, end);
    return root;
}

Node* mergeTrees(Node* root1, Node* root2) {
    stack<Node*> s1, s2;
    Node* current1 = root1;
    Node* current2 = root2;
    vector<int> result;
    while (current1 != NULL || current2 != NULL || !s1.empty() || !s2.empty())
    {
        while (current1 != NULL)
        {
            s1.push(current1);
            current1 = current1->left;
        }
        while (current2 != NULL)
        {
            s2.push(current2);
            current2 = current2->left;
        }
        if (s2.empty() || (!s1.empty() && s1.top()->data <= s2.top()->data))
        {
            current1 = s1.top();
            s1.pop();
            result.push_back(current1->data);
            current1 = current1->right;
        }
        else
        {
            current2 = s2.top();
            s2.pop();
            result.push_back(current2->data);
            current2 = current2->right;
        }
    }
    return constructBalancedBST(result, 0, result.size() - 1);
}
```

What does the above code do ?

- It first pushes the leftmost nodes of both trees into the stack.
- Then it compares the top nodes of both stacks and pushes the smaller one into the result vector.
- If s1 is empty then it pops s2 and puts the popped node value in the result vector.
- if s2 is empty then it pops s1 and puts the popped node value in the result vector.
- once both the stacks are empty and the result vector is filled with the inorder traversal of the merged tree, we construct the balanced BST from the result vector.

# Some more problems

> Just found these really intresting problems and thought of adding them here.

## 1. Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree

- You can find the problem [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

The following solution is pretty much rudimentary. It shows how [`Level Order Traversal`](#5-level-order-traversal) can be used to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

class Codec {
public:
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        string ans = "";
        TreeNode* temp = root;
        queue<TreeNode*>q;
        q.push(temp);
        while(!q.empty())
        {
            for(int i = 0; i<q.size(); i++)
            {
                if(q.front() != nullptr)
                {
                    ans+=to_string(q.front()->val);
                    ans+='#';
                    q.push(q.front()->left);
                    q.push(q.front()->right);
                }
                else
                {
                    ans+="null#";
                }
                q.pop();
            }
        }
        return ans;

    }

TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
    vector<string> nodes;
    int l = 0, r = 0;
    while (l < data.size()) {
        while (r < data.size() && data[r] != '#') {
            r++;
        }
        nodes.push_back(data.substr(l, r - l));
        l = r + 1;
        r = l;
    }

    if(nodes[0] == "null")
        return nullptr;

    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(stoi(nodes[0]));
    queue<TreeNode*>q;
    q.push(root);
    int ind = 1;

    while(!q.empty())
    {
        TreeNode* curr = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if(nodes[ind]!="null")
        {
            TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(stoi(nodes[ind]));
            curr->left = temp;
            q.push(temp);
        }
        else
        {
            curr->left = nullptr;
        }
        ind++;

        if(nodes[ind]!="null")
        {
            TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(stoi(nodes[ind]));
            curr->right = temp;
            q.push(temp);
        }
        else
        {
            curr->right = nullptr;
        }
        ind++;
    }
    return root;
}

};

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec ser, deser;
// TreeNode* ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root));
```

The idea is to add some delimiters so that we can keep track of node values and null values. The `serialize` function uses a queue to perform level order traversal and adds the node values to the string. The `deserialize` function splits the string into node values and null values and constructs the binary tree using a queue.

    string getDirections(TreeNode* root, int startValue, int destValue) {
        std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);

        root = LCA(root, startValue, destValue);
        string pathFrom = "", pathTo = "";
        dfs(root,startValue,pathFrom,1);

Here we are finding the path as a string from the Source to its lowest common ancestor and then from the lowest common ancestor to the destination. We are using a boolean variable to keep track of the direction of the path.

Lets say we want a more generic solution where we can find the path and distance from any node to any node.
We want to return a vector of TreeNodes which are in the path from source to destination.

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    TreeNode* LCA(TreeNode* root, int& p, int& q){
        if(root == nullptr || root->val == p || root->val == q)
            return root;
        TreeNode* left = LCA(root->left,p,q);
        TreeNode* right = LCA(root->right,p,q);
        if (left == nullptr)
            return right;
        if (right == nullptr)
            return left;
        return root;

    }

    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int x, vector<pair<TreeNode*,char>>&path,bool rev){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        if(root->val == x){
            return 1;
        }
        char dir = rev ? 'U' : 'L';
        path.push_back({root,dir});
        if(dfs(root->left,x,path))
            return 1;
        path.pop_back();

        dir = rev ? 'U' : 'R';
        path.push_back({root,dir});
        if(dfs(root->right,x,path))
            return 1;
        path.pop_back();

        return 0;
    }

    vector<pair<TreeNode*,char>> getDirections(TreeNode* root, int startValue, int destValue){
        TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor = LCA(root,startValue,destValue);
        vector<pair<TreeNode*,char>> pathSrc,pathDes,path;
        dfs(lowestCommonAncestor,startValue,pathSrc,1);
        dfs(lowestCommonAncestor,destValue,pathDest,0);

        if(pathSrc.empty() || pathDest.empty())
            return path;

        for(auto i : pathSrc)
            path.push_back(i);
        for(auto i : pathDest)
            path.push_back(i);

        int pathlen = path.size();

        return path;
    }
